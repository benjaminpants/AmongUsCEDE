# THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE, AND THE BELOW README TALKS ABOUT FEATURES THAT AREN'T IMPLEMENTED YET



# Among Us Community Edition (Definitive Edition)
## _The Most Customizable Among Us Experience._

Among Us CE: DE allows the player to configure their game to fit their specific playstyle.
All gamemodes are implemented in Lua scripts, meaning they can be changed without needing to be compiled.

## Complete Customization
Among Us CE: DE allows complete customization of the user experience.
Not only are there a variety of built-in gamemodes that each have a wide range of settings, users can easily create their own with the power of lua scripting.
Among Us CE: DE also allows the easy creation of custom hats and colors.

## The Idea

Among Us CE: DE plans to lower the barrier of entry for creating Among Us mods, and hopefully get tons of people into programming that wouldn't have even given it a shot otherwise.

As Ben(the founder of the project) once said.
> If I managed to inspire atleast one person, give them the same spark and interest in modding that I had..
> Then it was all worth it.

## Compilation

Among Us CE:DE requires the following libaries:
- [Moonsharp](https://www.moonsharp.org/)
- [Newtonsoft JSON](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
- All the files from Il2cpp Bepinex's Core folder and the unhollowed dlls.

Once you grabbed the above files, put them in the Dependencies folder and press build, then you can install it as a BepInEx plugin.




P.S This is a WIP
